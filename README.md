# pokemon-fullstack-2025

This is a project that demonstrate and learn different techniques, languages and frameworks. The main goal is to build a simple Pokédex app with a frontend and a backend.
The frontend is built with Angular and the only backend for now is built with Node.js and TypeScript.

The app is a simple Pokédex app that allows you to search for Pokémons, add them to a wishlist, and catch them. The idea is that by time you can connect it to various backends locally, so that different languages and solutions can be explored.

The app also has a contact page that allows you to send a message to the app's author. The app is built with a clean architecture and while this structure would make it tedious and difficult to deploy and scale the apps separately it's ideal for local development, exploration and learning.

Detailed steps to run / configure apps is in their respective README.md files.
